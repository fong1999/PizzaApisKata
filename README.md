# PizzaApisKata
A kata for building REST Api's using SpringBoot and Deploying to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.

# Prerequsites:
1. Java development Kit (JDK 8) - [Download here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
1. Maven 3.x - [Download Maven here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
1. An IDE or Text Editor (Use your favorite). Some options if you don't have one: [SpringSource Tool Suite - Eclipse based](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. AWS Account.  Free tier is should suffice, but you will have to enter a credit card number if you don't have an account already. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)


# The GOAL

The goal is to implement the following OAS/Swagger using SpringBoot RestControllers.:  [PizzaShop OAS](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/btarlton/PizzaShop/1.0.0)

The data you return can all be mocked if need be as the goal is not necessarily to have a completely working application, but understanding how to work with SpringBoot, RestControllers, and then how to deploy to AWS using CodePipeline.

# Getting started

## create a starter project
Start by creating a SpringBoot application.  Using the Spring Initializr(https://start.spring.io/) is a good way to start.
You will need the Web(SpringMVC) dependency and optionally I'd add Lombok for convenience.

After downloading and unziping the starter application, you can attempt to run it by using the following command:
``` 
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This utilizes the [spring boot maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/index.html)

**NOTE:** By default, Spring Boot using port 8080 to run.  So, be sure that port is free.

## Creating Your First Rest Controller

You can start by building a simple class annotated with [RestController](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html) that will be entry point to your application for your Pizza apis.

This will require creating a method that is annotated with the [RequestMapping](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html) annotation to map an HTTP request to your method.  This method could just return a hard coded string to get started with.

## Test your application

Once you've created your first RestController and RequestMapping to a method, you can run it using the **mvn spring-boot:run** command or from inside your STS IDE with a right click and Run As->Spring Boot App.  Either way, you'll then need to use [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/), [CURL](https://www.lifewire.com/example-uses-of-the-linux-curl-command-4084144), or some other tool to submit the appropriate HTTP request to your endpoint.  Your endpoint should be something like this by default **http://localhost:8080/pizzas**.  Of course, this URL can change depending on how you define your RequestMapping.


## Package your application For Deployment

When your first service is tested you can go ahead and attempt to package it and deploy to AWS. To package with maven simply run the following command: 
``` 
mvn clean package
```
This will build the application, run any tests, and package it as a [fat jar](https://www.baeldung.com/deployable-fat-jar-spring-boot).
[Spring's Jar Description](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/executable-jar.html)

This will create a target folder and in that folder you will find your jar.
You can test the jar locally by running the following command from the target folder
```
java -jar pizza-shop-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
